#What is this app?
A responsive web application that provides help desk/ticketing functionality.
The application should require authentication to access it with two roles (Admin and Standard)
existing for users. 
* Admin users can access all functions of the application including setup screens and managing users. 
* Standard users will see their dashboard and be able to enter tickets.
* Admin users will have a single view and will be able to switch to the help desk of different organizations in the application.
* Users will belong to a specific organization and will only be able to see tickets for their organization.
* Help desk tickets should have a basic description and category of the problem and should record who submitted the ticket
and when it was submitted. There will also be a status field to keep track of the current status of the ticket. 
* Each ticket can have comments added to it and comments should track the user who added the comment and when it was added.
* The main screen for a Standard User should be a dashboard that shows a graph that indicates the number of tickets created across all users within the organization by day. Below that should be a list of the most recent tickets created for the logged in user.
